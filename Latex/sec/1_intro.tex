\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Predicting Pokémon battle outcomes is a complex task due to team interactions and strategic variability. In this project, we developed models to predict the winning team after a fixed number of turns, applying a structured data engineering process and testing various machine learning and ensemble methods to maximize accuracy.
